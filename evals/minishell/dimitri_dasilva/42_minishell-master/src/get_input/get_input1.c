#include "get_input.h"

/*
** Gets the characters entered in the command line by user. We need to handle
** specific cases:
** - Up / down keypresses to check history
** - Backspace keypresses to delete a character
** Multiline commands aren't supported.
** @param:	- [t_dlist *] double linked list with previous input as nodes. 
**						  As we only pass the pointer its order nor the amount
**						  of nodes is changed by get_input()
**			- [t_termcaps *] struct with terminal capabilities capabilities
** @return:	[char *] line entered without any alterations nor checks
** Line-by-line comments:
** @7		We initialize our buf where we are temporarely storing the input
**			from user. The size of BUFSIZ is 8192 (defined in stdio.h)
**			If the input is larger than 8192... embrace the SEGFAULT life
** @10		Important piece of code so let's split it: 
**			- "nb_char_read": having set canonical mode off means read() returns
**			after each keypress regardless of the buffer_size argument. But that
**			doesn't mean we are always reading one byte at a time. For the
**			letter 'A', only 1 char will be read but the up arrow taking 3 bytes
**			in ANSI code, nb_char_read will have a value of 3
**			- "&buf[i]": we set the new character read after all previous
**			buffer. The i index is updated in parse_input_history(), in
**			delete_single_char() and by write().
**			- "BUFSIZ - i": size left in our buffer
** @13-14	We compare the values just read to the ANSI value of the backspace
**			that we received from the termcaps lib.
**			Here we need to keep in mind that the buffer has been previously set
**			to NULL so the new value set in the buffer are NULL-terminated
** @15-16	If the number of characters read is above 2 bytes and it's not
**			up / down arrow or backspace, it means it's a special character that
**			should not be writting on the stdout like Home. Yet it's in our
**			buffer so we need to set to NULL starting where that special
**			characters was stored
**			Because of bit encoding (I think), extended ASCII characters
**			(e.g. Ã©, @) take 2 bytes instead of 1
**			Ctrl + <letter> may cause unexpected behaviours, is_ctrl() makes
**			the only ctrl combinaision's allowed are ctrl - c and ctrl - d
** @17-18	When user presses ctrl-c, End of Text (ASCII code 3) is sent to
**			buffer. The expected behaviour is to write "^C" to stdout and reset
**			the command line
** @19-20	When user presses ctrl-d, End of Transmission (ASCII code 4) is sent
**			to the buffer. The expected behaviour is to write "exit" and to exit
**			the shell
** @21-22	We know that only one character has been read so we can safely write
**			it to STDOUT while incrementing i so that next character is read
**			after the one just written
