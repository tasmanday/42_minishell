** [t_list *cmds] linked list with simple commands (t_cmd *) as nodes
** [char *delimiter] Indicates what is separating this cmd table from the next
** Potential values:
** - delimiter = "\0" (last command table)
** - delimiter = ";" (consecutive execution of the next cmd table)
** - delimiter = "||" (execution of the next cmd table only if the previous has
** a falsy exit_status)
** - delimiter = "&&"" (execution of the next cmd table only if the previous has
** a truthy exit_status)
** [int nb_cmds] number of simple commands in cmds linked list]
** [int **pipes] 2D array of ints. Each subarray is a pipe
** [t_list *pids] linked list of pid. Works as a queue / FIFO data structure.
** Each time we fork(), we add a node at the back. We wait on dead child
** processses as long the queue is not empty
** [int return_value] return value of this specific command table. We also have
** t_msh an exit_status field for that intent. But we need to make sure we don't
** ignore return value of builtin functions (like cd), if they finish first than
** forks like:
** - "sleep 5 | cd wrong_folder", cd would set error because wrong direction but
** sleep would execute correctly. So cd sets the exit_status not sleep
